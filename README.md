Hello, my name is Luke Henderson. I am a Junior at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh majoring in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design with minors in Information Science and Studio Arts. Within this repository, feel free to look at some of the coding files I have developed throughout my time here at Pitt. Some of my projects consist of 3D prints and their files, a data visualization project, HTML website design projects, Java projects, and a Lorax Video game I created on Unity Game Engine and coded with C++.
